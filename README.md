# JobsPortal
Jobs Portal on Django (JetBrains Academy's project)

This Django project emulates employment portal where managers can add vacancies and candidates can create resumes. Both of them require authentication to do that. Otherwise, user can only view the list of vacancies and resumes. User data is stored in SQLite database.
